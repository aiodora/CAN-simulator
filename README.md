# CAN Simulator

Simulation of a Controller Area Network (CAN), focusing on critical elements such as message arbitration, error detection, and priority-based message transmission.

## Overview
The CAN Simulator is a Python-based tool designed to mimic the behavior of a real CAN network. It emphasizes key aspects of CAN communication including:
- **Message Arbitration**: Simulates how messages compete for bus access and are prioritized based on their IDs.
- **Error Detection**: Emulates error states and recovery mechanisms to reflect real-world CAN error handling.
- **Priority-based Transmission**: Demonstrates how the priority of messages influences transmission order on the network.

## Features
- **Realistic Simulation**: Accurately models the core behaviors of a CAN network.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjust simulation settings (e.g., transmission rates, message priorities, error injection) to suit your testing needs.
- **Python-Powered**: Leverages the simplicity and flexibility of Python for rapid development and experimentation.
- **Extensible Design**: Built with modularity in mind, allowing for future expansion such as multi-node simulations or integration with other tools.
- **Intuitive GUI**: The graphical user interface is built using [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter), providing an easy-to-use and modern control panel for the simulator.

## Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is provided along with the repository. The documentation includes with photo gallery showcasing the simulator setup and GUI, which helps you get a clear visual understanding of the tool in action.
